Competition Background and Objectives:
• The efficiency of solar photovoltaic devices continues to improve, and green energy technology has become a consensus for the future development of the world. Development is also advancing by leaps and bounds. AI green energy is a good topic for talent cultivation.

• This competition selects microclimate environmental factors for measurement and data collection based on relevant literature on energy technology. Install solar panels to measure power generation as ground truth

• In line with the theme of green energy technology, it can help AI CUP students understand the green energy technology industry and help Bay Green Energy Technology Development

• The theme is to predict the solar power generation of the day, which will help Taiwan's power grid to regulate power every day

• The content provides weather data for each device every minute, using the forecast day before to the morning of the forecast day. Based on the data before 9:00, the power generation wattage will be predicted every 10 minutes after 9:00 on the same day, and the prediction will continue until 5:00 pm that day, there were 48 predictions, and the sum of the errors was the total score.
